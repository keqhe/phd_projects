\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This work provides 3 benefits:
1)unified low latency, regardless of congestion control algorithms VMs use
2)ECT (e.g., DCTCP) and non-ECT (e.g., CUBIC) can co-exist well on the same network
3)improved TCP fairness, regardless of congestion control algorithms VMs use

Our scheme is compatible with any TCP variant. It is easy to implement, highly scalable and has very little overhead.
