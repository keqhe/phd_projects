\subsubsection{Modification Latency}

We observe that the per-rule modification latency on \BroadcomOne and \IBM is 
impacted purely by table occupancy, not by rule priority structure.
Conversations with Broadcom indicated that TCAM modification should ideally be fast and independent of table size,
so the underlying cause appears to be less optimized switch software in \BroadcomOne.
For \BroadcomThree and \Intel, the per-rule modification delay 
%is 1 ms respectively 
is independent of rule priority, table occupancy, and burst size;
\BroadcomThree's per-rule modification delay is 2X higher than insertion.
%Indeed, our measurements with \BroadcomThree show that this issue has (at least partly) been fixed.
