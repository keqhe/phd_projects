\subsubsection{Deletion Latency}

For BCM-1.0, BCM-1.3, Intel and IBM, deletion latency is not affected
by the priorities of rules in the table or the order of deletion.
However, deletion delay is affected by table occupancy---it decreases with rule number 
in all the switches we measured. Thus we infer that deletion is incurring TCAM reordering.
%We also observe that processing rule timeouts at the switch does not
%noticeably impact \flowmod operations.
