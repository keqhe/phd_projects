\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Critical SDN applications such as fast failover and fine-grained traffic
engineering demand fast interaction between switch control and data planes.
However, our measurements of four SDN switches show the latencies
underlying the generation of control messages and the execution of control
operations can be quite high, and variable. 
%
%A subset of our findings highlight problems with the software implementation
%on OpenFlow switches: e.g., rule insertion latencies are 3ms with
%\BroadcomOne, which is significantly higher than the update rate that TCAM
%hardware natively supports~\cite{estan:private}.  We believe near term work
%will reduce such issues, as indicated by improved latencies in \BroadcomThree.
%However, given that software ``glue'' will continue to exist between control
%and data planes in SDN switches, we remain skeptical whether latencies will
%ever reach what hardware can natively support.
%
%Our measurements also reveal root causes of latency that appear to be
%fundamentally entrenched in hardware design: e.g., rules must be organized in
%the TCAM in a priority order for correct and efficient matching; also,
%\packetin, \flowmod, and \packetout messages must contend for limited bus
%bandwidth between a switch's CPU and ASIC. Unless the hardware significantly
%changes, we believe the latencies we identify will continue to manifest in
%next generation switches.  
%
We find that the underlying causes are linked to software inefficiencies, as
well as pathological interactions between switch hardware properties (shared
resources and how forwarding rules are organized) and the control operation
workload (the order of operations, and concurrent switch activities). 
%%Our measurements highlight the need for careful design of next generation
%%switch silicon and software in order to fully utilize the power of SDN.
%Given the software ``glue'' between switch control and data planes and the
%long upgrade cycles of switch hardware, we believe the latencies we identify
%will continue to manifest even in next generation switches.  
These findings highlight the need for careful design of future switch
silicon and software in order to fully utilize the power of SDN.
