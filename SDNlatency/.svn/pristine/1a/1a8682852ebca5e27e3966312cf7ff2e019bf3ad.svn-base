Timely interaction between an SDN controller and switches is crucial to many
SDN applications---e.g., fast rerouting during link failure and fine-grained
traffic engineering in data centers. However, it is not well understood how
the control plane in SDN switches impacts these applications. To this end, we
conduct a comprehensive measurement study using four
types of production SDN switches. Our measurements show that control actions,
such as rule installation, have surprisingly high latency, due to both
software implementation inefficiencies and fundamental traits of switch
hardware.  
\iffalse
Simulations based on our measurements indicate that these high
latencies render SDN incapable of supporting key control applications. 
Since the hardware changes necessary to lower latencies are likely 5+ years
away, we propose three immediately deployable measurement-driven latency
mitigation techniques: optimizing route selection, spreading rules across
switches, and reordering rule installations. Simulations show that
our techniques can reduce the latency to update network state by almost 5X.

\iffalse
  Achieving responsive and efficient network control using SDN relies
  crucially on the underlying network quickly executing key
  interactions with the controller, such as generating messages or
  installing controller-provided rules. Even if individual switches
  impose undue latencies during such interactions, the logically
  central view and global control in SDN can facilitate simple schemes
  to mitigate them and limit the impact on management applications. To
  inform the design of such mitigation schemes, we conduct a
  measurement study of latencies involved in key switch interactions
  with an SDN controller across three vendor platforms. We find that
  the latencies are significant, and can arise both due to software
  implementation inefficiencies as well as fundamental traits of
  underlying hardware. To overcome the latencies and achieve
  responsive control, we develop three general techniques: physical
  decoupling of switch-side functionality in processing SDN messages
  to/from the switch; workload engineering to spread rule updates
  across paths and within a path in order to cut down installation
  latency by executing parallel updates; and multipath probing to
  account for unpredictable latency variation from switch actions that
  cannot be directly controlled. Controlled simulations and testbed
  experiments show that our techniques can effectively mitigate
  latencies and help a variety of stringent control applications.  \fi
