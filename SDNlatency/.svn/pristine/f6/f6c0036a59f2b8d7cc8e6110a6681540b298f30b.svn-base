\section{Latency Measurements}\label{sec-measure}


In this section, we systematically measure in/outbound latencies to
understand what factors contribute to high latencies. We generate a variety
of workloads to isolate specific factors, and we use production switches from
\numVendors vendors, running switch software with support for OpenFlow
1.0~\cite{openflow} or, if available, OpenFlow 1.3, to highlight the
generality of our observations and to understand how software evolution
impacts latencies.\footnote{When using OpenFlow 1.3 firmware, we
only leverage features also available in OpenFlow 1.0 for an apples-to-apples comparison.} 
Henceforth, we refer to the \numCombos hardware and software combinations
(\tabref{switch_para}) as \Intel, \BroadcomOne, \BroadcomThree, and \IBM.
To ensure we are experimenting in the optimal regimes for each switch, we take
into account factors such as flow table capacity and support for \packetin.

%An important first step to taming in/outbound latencies is to
%understand the various factors that affect them 
%within the SDN switch. We conduct a variety of measurements aimed at
%carefully isolating these factors. To draw general observation, we use
%three types of commercial switch platforms (\tabref{switch_para}).
%To ensure that we are experimenting in the optimal regimes for the different
%switches we take into account switch specifics such as maximum flow table sizes
%as well as support for priority in rule set up. 

%We also make the distinction on the types of rule tables supported by the
%different switches.  
%1) Broadcom 956846K, 
%2) Intel FM6000 (model IZ1), 
%and 3) HP Procurve 8212zl.
%The specific details for each switch are shown in 
%\keqhe{Broadcom switch can only support proactive rule insertions while Intel
%and HP switch can support both proactive and reactive rule insertions.}
