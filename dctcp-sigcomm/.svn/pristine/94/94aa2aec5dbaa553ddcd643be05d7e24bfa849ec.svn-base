\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{background}

\subsection{Why Transport Enforcement?}

\subsection{TCP Windowing}
Initially, TCP only has RWND to achieve flow control 
(i.e., prevent sender from overflowing receiver's buffer).
In 1988, Jacobson~\cite{jacobson1988congestion} identifed the causes of ``congestion collapse''
and added CWND and congestion avoidance and control algorithms to fix the issue for the Internet.
In the datacenter network environment 
(hypervisors, containers\todo{is this correct?}, 
and switches owned by the cloud provider; VMs rented to customers), 
RWND can be repurposed to achieve two goals---
flow control and ``transport enforcement'', in one single parameter.

\subsection{Virtual Switch}
Open vSwitch (OVS)~\cite{ovs-website}, Cisco Application Virtual Switch~\cite{cisco-avs}, 
and VALE~\cite{rizzo2012vale}.
zOVN~\cite{crisan2013got} identified the packet loss problem in virtual networks and
proposed zVALE virtual switch to achieve lossless overlay virtual networks.
Open vSwitch (OVS) acceleration in the NIC~\cite{cavium-nic,netronome-nic}.
