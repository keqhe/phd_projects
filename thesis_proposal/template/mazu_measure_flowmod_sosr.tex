\subsubsection{Dissecting Outbound Delay} 
\label{mazu-outbound_meas}

We now study the outbound latencies for three different \flowmod\
operations: insertion, modification, and deletion. For each operation, we
examine the latency impact of key factors, including table
occupancy and rule priority.
Before measuring outbound latency, we install a single default low priority
rule which instructs the switch to drop all traffic. We then install a set of
non-overlapping OpenFlow rules that
eth2 interface of our measurement host. For some experiments, we 
systematically vary the rule priorities.
