\subsection{Implications}


A subset of our findings highlight 
problems with the firm\-ware on OpenFlow switches:
e.g., rule insertion latencies are 3ms with \BroadcomOne, which is significantly higher than the 
update rate that TCAM hardware natively supports~\cite{estan:private}. 
We believe near term work will reduce such issues, as indicated by
improved latencies in \BroadcomThree. 
However, given that software will continue to bridge 
control and data planes in SDN switches, we remain skeptical whether 
latencies will ever reach what hardware can natively support.


Our measurements also reveal root causes of latency that appear to be
fundamentally entrenched in hardware design: e.g., rules 
must be organized in the TCAM in a priority order for correct and efficient matching; 
also, \packetin, \flowmod, and \packetout messages must contend for limited
bus bandwidth between a switch's CPU and ASIC. Unless the hardware
significantly changes, we believe the latencies we identify
will continue to manifest in next generation switches.
