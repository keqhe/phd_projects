\subsubsection{Popular Cloud-Using (Sub)Domains} 
\label{cloud-measure-global}

\tightparagraph{Cloud-using Alexa domains} We now consider what subset of the 
Alexa top 1 million websites use the cloud to (partly) host their services. 
Recall that Alexa provides an estimate of the most
popular domains worldwide. Their ranking is based on the number of unique
visitors and the number of page views over the last 3 months, aggregated at the
domain level\footnote{Except for domains hosting personal sites, e.g.,
\myurl{wordpress.com}, where subdomains are ranked
individually.}~\cite{alex_topdomains}.  
Using our \alexadata dataset, we can determine which Alexa sites are hosted in
EC2/Azure.
%Determining the reliance on EC2/Azure
%of  such popular sites  allows us to assess the extent
%this macroscopic perspective on website popularity 
%to begin to quantify what web domains use public IaaS clouds.

We find that 40,333 ($\mathord{>}4\%$) of the domains on Alexa's top 1 million
list have a subdomain that uses EC2 and/or Azure.
Under these domains, there are a
total of 713,910 cloud-using subdomains. 
Note that these are lower bounds on cloud use, since our
analysis approach (see \S\ref{cloud-measure-datasets}) means we do not flag as
cloud-using any domains that use a layer of indirection (e.g., via services
like CloudFlare~\cite{cloudflare}) before requests are sent to EC2 or Azure. 

\tabref{tab:hybrid_cloud} provides a breakdown of the domains and
subdomains in terms of whether they use EC2, Azure, or other hosting
services (the last indicating
IP addresses not associated with EC2 or Azure).  Note that ``other''
could in fact be public clouds besides EC2 and Azure. 
A subdomain is marked as {\em EC2 only} if it always resolves only to IP 
addresses within EC2; similarly for Azure. We mark a subdomain as {\em
EC2+Azure}, {\em EC2+Other}, or {\em Azure+Other} if it resolves to IP 
addresses associated with the appropriate subset of EC2, Azure, and other.
Domains are counted as {\em EC2 only}
if all of their subdomains only use EC2; similarly for Azure. Domains are 
marked as {\em EC2+Azure}, {\em EC2+Other}, or {\em Azure+Other} if they have 
subdomains associated with
the indicated subset of EC2, Azure, and other. 

\begin{table}[!t]

\caption{Breakdown of domains and subdomains based on their use of EC2, 
    Azure, and/or other hosting services.}
\label{tab:hybrid_cloud}
\end{table}





The vast majority of cloud-using domains (94.9\%) use EC2, and the majority of
these domains use other hosting for some of their subdomains (i.e., EC2 + Other).  
{Only 5.8\% of domains use Azure.  Additionally, a small
fraction (0.7\%) of cloud-using domains use both EC2 and Azure; hence
the {\em EC2 total} and {\em Azure total} rows in \tabref{tab:hybrid_cloud}
sum to more than 100\%.
A list of the top 10 (by Alexa rank) EC2-using domains 
appears in \tabref{tab:top-15}. This list will be used in several later 
sections with results specific  to EC2, which is why we excluded the four 
top Azure domains 
that would otherwise have been in the top~10: \myurl{live.com}, \myurl{msn.com}, \myurl{bing.com}, and \myurl{microsoft.com}.

The distribution of Alexa ranks for cloud-using domains 
is skewed: higher ranked domains are more likely 
to be cloud-using than lower ranked domains. 
%a larger fraction of higher-ranked domains use EC2 and/or Azure
%compared to lower-ranked domains 
%Figure~\ref{fig:cdf-alexa} shows a CDF of the percentage of cloud-using 
%domains with rank less than or equal to the indicated x-axis values. 
Notably, 42.3\% of cloud-using domains have ranks in 
the first 250,000 sites versus only 16.2\% of the bottom 250K domains. 
%In Figure~\ref{fig:top-15} we list the top 15 EC2-using 
%Alexa domains, and the number of subdomains they use both 
%in and out of the cloud. 

The most frequent prefix used by cloud-using subdomains in our Alexa 
subdomains dataset is \myurl{www} (3.3\% of all cloud-using subdomains). The other top 10 prefixes
(each $\mathord{<}1\%$) are, in order:
\myurl{m}, \myurl{ftp}, \myurl{cdn}, \myurl{mail},
\myurl{staging}, \myurl{blog}, \myurl{support}, \myurl{test}, and \myurl{dev}.
%A small handful of domains use both EC2 and Azure. 
The majority of subdomains are hosted either only in
the cloud or only elsewhere, although a small fraction (3\%) appear to be
hosted both on EC2 and other providers,
what we might call a hybrid-cloud deployment.

\label{tab:topdomains}
\end{table*}

\tightparagraph{High traffic volume domains}
We complement the above with an analysis of the top domains seen in 
the \captureonedata, as measured by traffic volume.  
We use Bro to extract 
hostnames within HTTP requests and common names within the server
certificates embedded in HTTPS flows\footnote{TLS
encryption hides the hostname associated with the underlying HTTP
requests, so we use the common names found in TLS server
certificates as a proxy.}. Aggregating the hostnames and common
names by domain, we find 13,604 unique cloud-using domains:
12,720 use EC2 and 885 use Azure.  Of these 13,604 domains, 6902 were also
identified as cloud-using via the Alexa dataset; the remainder were not in
the Alexa top 1 million.
\tabref{tab:topdomains} lists the highest 15 such 
domains in terms of traffic volume. A few tenants 
are responsible for a large fraction of the traffic. Most notably, 
\myurl{dropbox.com} accounts for almost 70\% of the combined HTTP(S) traffic volume. 
This also explains why HTTPS (used by \myurl{dropbox.com}) dominates HTTP 
in terms of volume (though not number of flows, refer to
        \tabref{tab:proserv}). 


It is informative to compare our analysis of top EC2-using domains by traffic
volume to the analysis by DeepField networks~\cite{deepfield}, 
which was conducted three months
before we collected the \captureonedata. They used data from
customers of their network analysis products. Seven of the domains on our top
15 list also appear within the top 15 on DeepField's list (indicated with a
        ($\deepfield$) in \tabref{tab:topdomains}).

\tightparagraph{Summary and implications} A substantial fraction of the
world's most popular websites rely in whole or in part on public IaaS
clouds, especially EC2.  Most cloud-using domains have some subdomains
hosted on a cloud service while other subdomains are hosted elsewhere.
Perhaps surprisingly a small, but noticeable fraction of subdomains
use both a cloud and other hosting solutions. Finally, traffic volume
appears to be dominated by a few cloud tenants (we discuss traffic
patterns more next). Depending on how tenants' deploy their services
(e.g., how many and which regions they use), these observations have
implications for availability of web-based cloud-resident services. We
explore the underlying deployments in more detail in \secref{cloud-measure-how}.
