Public IaaS clouds, such as Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, and Rackspace,
allow tenants to dynamically rent virtual machine (VM) instances with
varying CPU, network, and storage capacity. Cloud tenants have the
option of renting VMs in one or more geographically distinct
data centers, or {\em regions}. Some clouds, such as EC2,
further divide these regions into multiple distinct availability {\em
  zones}. Each zone has separate compute and power
infrastructure to make certain failure modes zone-specific and to
allow cloud tenants to replicate their deployments across
multiple zones for smooth fail-over.

Beyond simple VMs, IaaS providers, as well as third parties, offer a
wide-range of value-added features: load balancers (e.g., Amazon
Elastic Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager),
plat\-form-as-a-service environments (e.g., Amazon Elastic
Beanstalk, Heroku, and Azure Cloud Services), content-distribution networks
(e.g., Amazon CloudFront and Azure Media Services), DNS hosting (e.g.,
Amazon route53), etc. The result is a complex ecosystem of
interdependent systems operating at multiple layers of abstraction,
and, in turn, a large variety of possible deployment patterns for
cloud tenants. In this paper, we study four popular deployment patterns. We
describe these using a series of examples.

In \figref{fig:ec2_models}, we show the steps involved in a client
accessing an EC2-hosted web service that is using one or more of the
aforementioned features. When a client wants to access a web service,
it first performs a DNS lookup of the service's domain name.  The
response may contain an IP address associated with a VM (deployment
pattern {\em P1}), a load balancer ({\em P2}), or a
platform-as-a-service (PaaS) node ({\em P3}).
With {\em P2}, the client request is subsequently directed to a
VM\footnote{Or PaaS
  nodes, as is done by Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and Azure Traffic
  Manager.}. Tenants using {\em P1}--{\em P3} may also rely on
additional VMs or systems (dashed lines) to handle a
client's request; these additional components may or may not be in the
same region or availability zone (indicated by the gray boxes). An
object returned to a client (e.g., a web page) may sometimes require
the client to obtain additional objects (e.g., a video) from a
content-distribution network ({\em P4}).

We focus on studying the front end portions of web
service deployments within the above four deployment patterns (indicated by 
the thicker lines in \figref{fig:ec2_models}). These
portions are encountered within the initial few steps of a client
making a request. We leave an exploration of deployment/usage patterns
covering the later steps (e.g. back-end processing) for future work.
