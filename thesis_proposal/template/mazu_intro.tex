Timely interaction between an SDN controller and switches is crucial to many
SDN applications---e.g., fast rerouting during link failure and fine-grained
traffic engineering in data centers. However, it is not well understood how
the control plane in SDN switches impacts these applications. To this end, we
conduct a comprehensive measurement study using four
types of production SDN switches. Our measurements show that control actions,
such as rule installation, have surprisingly high latency, due to both
software implementation inefficiencies and fundamental traits of switch
hardware.

Based on our measurements, we propose three techniques to mitigate the outbound latencies
imposed by current switches:
{\em Flow engineering} (FE) leverages our empirical latency models to compute
paths such that the latency of installing forwarding state at any
switch is minimized.
{\em Rule
  offloading} (RO) computes strategies for opportunistically
offloading installation of some forwarding state to downstream switches.
Finally, {\em rule reordering} (RR) sends rule installation
requests in an order that is optimal for the switch in question. By reducing
installation latency per switch (FE + RR) and enabling network-wide parallel
updates (RO),
rule updates can finish much faster.
