\subsection{Latency Measurements}
\label{mazu-measure}

In this section, we systematically measure in/outbound latencies to
understand what factors contribute to high latencies. We generate a variety
of workloads to isolate specific factors, and we use production switches from
\numVendors vendors, running switch software with support for OpenFlow
1.0~\cite{openflow} or, if available, OpenFlow 1.3, to highlight the
generality of our observations and to understand how software evolution
impacts latencies.\footnote{When using OpenFlow 1.3 firmware, we
only leverage features also available in OpenFlow 1.0 for an apples-to-apples comparison.} 
Henceforth, we refer to the \numCombos hardware and software combinations
(\tabref{switch_para}) as \Intel, \BroadcomOne, \BroadcomThree, and \IBM.
To ensure we are experimenting in the optimal regimes for each switch, we take
into account factors such as flow table capacity and support for \packetin.
