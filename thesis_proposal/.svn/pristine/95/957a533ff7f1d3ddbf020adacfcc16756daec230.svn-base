\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{mazu-conclusion}
Critical SDN applications such as fast failover and fine-grained traffic engineering demand
tight interaction between switch control and data planes. However, our
measurements across four OpenFlow-based switches show that the
latencies underlying the generation of control messages (\packetin's)
and execution of control operations (\flowmod's) can be quite high, and
variable. We find that the underlying causes are linked both to
software inefficiencies, as well as pathological interactions between
switch hardware properties (shared resources and how forwarding rules
are organized) and the control operation workload (the order of
operations issues, and concurrent switch activities). 
Our measurement study highlights the need of careful design of next generation switch silicon 
and software in order to fully utilize the power of SDN.
Finally, to mitigate the
challenges these latencies create for SDN in supporting critical
management applications, we present three measurement-driven techniques.
Our evaluation shows that these mechanisms can tame flow setup
latencies effectively, thereby enabling SDN-based control of critical
applications.
