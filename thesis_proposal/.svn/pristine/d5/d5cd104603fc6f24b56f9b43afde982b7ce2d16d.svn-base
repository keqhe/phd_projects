\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{cloud-measure-conclusion}

In this work we performed the first extensive measurement study of
usage of modern infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) clouds, in
particular Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure. This measurement study, which combined data
from a university packet capture, interrogation of DNS records for
websites listed on the Alexa top 1 million list, and lightweight
probing, confirms the oft-reported anecdotes about the extent to which
modern web services use these cloud systems.  We profile the
deployment patterns observed for popular web services.  We uncover
that, in many ways, these deployments are somewhat precarious, as the
vast majority of (even very popular) websites use only one cloud
region.  In addition to resiliency benefits, we show that multi-region
deployments could significantly increase latency and throughput
performance in EC2.
Beyond providing a snapshot on the state of cloud usage, we
believe our work will spark further research on 
tracking cloud usage, as well as developing 
cloud-region-aware routing and deployment mechanisms.
Finally, we make all data sets used in 
this paper publicly available~\cite{cloudmeasuredata}, with the
exception of the \captureonedata.
