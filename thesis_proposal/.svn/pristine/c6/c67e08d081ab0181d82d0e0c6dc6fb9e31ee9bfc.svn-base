\subsection{Tenants' Deployment Posture}
\label{cloud-measure-how}

In this section, we attempt to understand {\em how} tenants use
the cloud for deploying their front ends. We start by analyzing the deployment patterns employed by
cloud-using (sub)domains.  We first focus on the four 
patterns identified in \figref{fig:ec2_models}.  We then quantify how
many, and which, regions and availability zones are leveraged by
cloud-using (sub)domains' front ends.
