\subsection{Web-Facing Cloud Tenants}
\label{cloud-measure-who}

In this section, we explore what 
applications are being hosted on public IaaS clouds.
We start by analyzing the packet capture to identify the types of applications
being hosted. This analysis suggests (unsurprisingly) that web applications 
represent a large, important set of cloud tenants.
We then turn to examining which of the most popular websites 
are using clouds. We view popularity both globally, via
the Alexa top website  rankings, and locally, via 
the volume of traffic associated with each domain in the packet capture.
